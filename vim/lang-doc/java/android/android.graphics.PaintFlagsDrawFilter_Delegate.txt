*android.graphics.PaintFlagsDrawFilter_Delegate_Description*

Delegate implementing the native methods of 
android.graphics.PaintFlagsDrawFilter 

Through the layoutlib_create tool, the original native methods of 
PaintFlagsDrawFilter have been replaced by calls to methods of the same name in 
this delegate class. 

This class behaves like the original native implementation, but in Java, 
keeping previously native data into its own objects and mapping them to int 
that are sent back and forth between it and the original PaintFlagsDrawFilter 
class. 

Because this extends (|android.graphics.DrawFilter_Delegate|) , there's no need 
to use a (|com.android.layoutlib.bridge.impl.DelegateManager|) , as all the 
DrawFilter classes will be added to the manager owned by 
(|android.graphics.DrawFilter_Delegate|) .
