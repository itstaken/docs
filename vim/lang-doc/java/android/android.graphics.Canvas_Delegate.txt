*android.graphics.Canvas_Delegate_Description*

Delegate implementing the native methods of android.graphics.Canvas 

Through the layoutlib_create tool, the original native methods of Canvas have 
been replaced by calls to methods of the same name in this delegate class. 

This class behaves like the original native implementation, but in Java, 
keeping previously native data into its own objects and mapping them to int 
that are sent back and forth between it and the original Canvas class. 



*android.graphics.Canvas_Delegate.getDelegate(Canvas)*

public static |android.graphics.Canvas_Delegate| getDelegate(Canvas canvas)

Returns the native delegate associated to a given (|Canvas|) object. 



*android.graphics.Canvas_Delegate.getDrawFilter()*

public |android.graphics.DrawFilter_Delegate| getDrawFilter()

Returns the (|DrawFilter|) delegate or null if none have been set. 



    Returns: the delegate or null. 

*android.graphics.Canvas_Delegate.getSnapshot()*

public |com.android.layoutlib.bridge.impl.GcSnapshot| getSnapshot()

Returns the current (|java.awt.Graphics2D|) used to draw.
