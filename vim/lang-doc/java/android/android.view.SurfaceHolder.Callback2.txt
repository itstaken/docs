public void surfaceRedrawNeeded(android.view.SurfaceHolder holder)

Called when the application needs to redraw the content of its surface, after 
it is resized or for some other reason. By not returning from here until the 
redraw is complete, you can ensure that the user will not see your surface in a 
bad state (at its new size before it has been correctly drawn that way). This 
will typically be preceeded by a call to 
(|android.view.SurfaceHolder.Callback2|) . 


    holder - The SurfaceHolder whose surface has changed.
