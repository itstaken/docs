*android.content.ServiceConnection_Description*

Interface for monitoring the state of an application service. See 
(|android.app.Service|) and Context.bindService()(|android.content.Context|) 
for more information. Like many callbacks from the system, the methods on this 
class are called from the main thread of your process. 



*android.content.ServiceConnection.onServiceConnected(ComponentName,IBinder)*

public void onServiceConnected(
  android.content.ComponentName name,
  android.os.IBinder service)

Called when a connection to the Service has been established, with the 
(|android.os.IBinder|) of the communication channel to the Service. 


    name - The concrete component name of the service that has been connected. 
    service - The IBinder of the Service's communication channel, which you can now make 
       calls on. 

*android.content.ServiceConnection.onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName)*

public void onServiceDisconnected(android.content.ComponentName name)

Called when a connection to the Service has been lost. This typically happens 
when the process hosting the service has crashed or been killed. This does not 
remove the ServiceConnection itself -- this binding to the service will remain 
active, and you will receive a call to (|android.content.ServiceConnection|) 
when the Service is next running. 


    name - The concrete component name of the service whose connection has been lost.
