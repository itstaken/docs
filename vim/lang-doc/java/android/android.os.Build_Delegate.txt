*android.os.Build_Delegate_Description*

Delegate implementing the native methods of android.os.Build 

Through the layoutlib_create tool, the original native methods of Build have 
been replaced by calls to methods of the same name in this delegate class. 

Because it's a stateless class to start with, there's no need to keep a 
(|com.android.layoutlib.bridge.impl.DelegateManager|) around to map int to 
instance of the delegate.
