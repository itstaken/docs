*android.animation.TimeAnimator.TimeListener_Description*

Implementors of this interface can set themselves as update listeners to a 
TimeAnimator instance to receive callbacks on every animation frame to receive 
the total time since the animator started and the delta time since the last 
frame. The first time the listener is called, deltaTime will be zero. The same 
is true for totalTime, unless the animator was set to a specific 
currentPlayTime(|android.animation.ValueAnimator|) prior to starting. 



*android.animation.TimeAnimator.TimeListener.onTimeUpdate(TimeAnimator,long,long)*

public void onTimeUpdate(
  android.animation.TimeAnimator animation,
  long totalTime,
  long deltaTime)

Notifies listeners of the occurrence of another frame of the animation, along 
with information about the elapsed time. 


    animation - The animator sending out the notification. 
    totalTime - The total time elapsed since the animator started, in milliseconds. 
    deltaTime - The time elapsed since the previous frame, in milliseconds.
