*android.transition.Transition.TransitionListener_Description*

A transition listener receives notifications from a transition. Notifications 
indicate transition lifecycle events. 



*android.transition.Transition.TransitionListener.onTransitionCancel(Transition)*

public void onTransitionCancel(android.transition.Transition transition)

Notification about the cancellation of the transition. Note that cancel may be 
called by a parent (|android.transition.TransitionSet|) on a child transition 
which has not yet started. This allows the child transition to restore state on 
target objects which was set at 
createAnimator()(|android.transition.Transition.TransitionListener|) time. 


    transition - The transition which was canceled. 

*android.transition.Transition.TransitionListener.onTransitionEnd(Transition)*

public void onTransitionEnd(android.transition.Transition transition)

Notification about the end of the transition. Canceled transitions will always 
notify listeners of both the cancellation and end events. That is, 
(|android.transition.Transition.TransitionListener|) is always called, 
regardless of whether the transition was canceled or played through to 
completion. 


    transition - The transition which reached its end. 

*android.transition.Transition.TransitionListener.onTransitionPause(Transition)*

public void onTransitionPause(android.transition.Transition transition)

Notification when a transition is paused. Note that createAnimator() may be 
called by a parent (|android.transition.TransitionSet|) on a child transition 
which has not yet started. This allows the child transition to restore state on 
target objects which was set at 
createAnimator()(|android.transition.Transition.TransitionListener|) time. 


    transition - The transition which was paused. 

*android.transition.Transition.TransitionListener.onTransitionResume(Transition)*

public void onTransitionResume(android.transition.Transition transition)

Notification when a transition is resumed. Note that resume() may be called by 
a parent (|android.transition.TransitionSet|) on a child transition which has 
not yet started. This allows the child transition to restore state which may 
have changed in an earlier call to 
(|android.transition.Transition.TransitionListener|) . 


    transition - The transition which was resumed. 

*android.transition.Transition.TransitionListener.onTransitionStart(Transition)*

public void onTransitionStart(android.transition.Transition transition)

Notification about the start of the transition. 


    transition - The started transition.
