*android.widget.Advanceable_Description*

This interface can be implemented by any collection-type view which has a 
notion of progressing through its set of children. The interface exists to give 
AppWidgetHosts a way of taking responsibility for automatically advancing such 
collections. 



*android.widget.Advanceable.advance()*

public void advance()

Advances this collection, eg. shows the next view. 



*android.widget.Advanceable.fyiWillBeAdvancedByHostKThx()*

public void fyiWillBeAdvancedByHostKThx()

Called by the AppWidgetHost once before it begins to call advance(), allowing 
the collection to do any required setup.
