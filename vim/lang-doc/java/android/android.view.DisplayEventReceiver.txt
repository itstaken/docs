*android.view.DisplayEventReceiver_Description*

Provides a low-level mechanism for an application to receive display events 
such as vertical sync. 

The display event receive is NOT thread safe. Moreover, its methods must only 
be called on the Looper thread to which it is attached. 



*android.view.DisplayEventReceiver(Looper)*

public DisplayEventReceiver(android.os.Looper looper)

Creates a display event receiver. 

    looper - The looper to use when invoking callbacks. 

*android.view.DisplayEventReceiver.dispose()*

public void dispose()

Disposes the receiver. 



*android.view.DisplayEventReceiver.finalize()*

protected void finalize()
  throws |java.lang.Throwable|
         




*android.view.DisplayEventReceiver.onHotplug(long,int,boolean)*

public void onHotplug(
  long timestampNanos,
  int builtInDisplayId,
  boolean connected)

Called when a display hotplug event is received. 


    timestampNanos - The timestamp of the event, in the {@link System#nanoTime()} timebase. 
    builtInDisplayId - The surface flinger built-in display id such as {@link 
       SurfaceControl#BUILT_IN_DISPLAY_ID_HDMI}. 
    connected - True if the display is connected, false if it disconnected. 

*android.view.DisplayEventReceiver.onVsync(long,int,int)*

public void onVsync(
  long timestampNanos,
  int builtInDisplayId,
  int frame)

Called when a vertical sync pulse is received. The recipient should render a 
frame and then call (|android.view.DisplayEventReceiver|) to schedule the next 
vertical sync pulse. 


    timestampNanos - The timestamp of the pulse, in the {@link System#nanoTime()} timebase. 
    builtInDisplayId - The surface flinger built-in display id such as {@link 
       SurfaceControl#BUILT_IN_DISPLAY_ID_MAIN}. 
    frame - The frame number. Increases by one for each vertical sync interval. 

*android.view.DisplayEventReceiver.scheduleVsync()*

public void scheduleVsync()

Schedules a single vertical sync pulse to be delivered when the next display 
frame begins.
