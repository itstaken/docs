*android.os.CommonClock.OnServerDiedListener_Description*

The OnServerDiedListener interface defines a method called by the 
(|android.os.CommonClock|) instance to indicate that the connection to the 
native media server has been broken and that the (|android.os.CommonClock|) 
instance will need to be released and re-created. The client application can 
implement this interface and register the listener with the 
(|android.os.CommonClock.OnServerDiedListener|) method. 



*android.os.CommonClock.OnServerDiedListener.onServerDied()*

public void onServerDied()

Method called when the native media server has died. If the native common time 
service encounters a fatal error and needs to restart, the binder connection 
from the (|android.os.CommonClock|) instance to the common time service will be 
broken. To restore functionality, clients should 
(|android.os.CommonClock.OnServerDiedListener|) their old visualizer and create 
a new instance.
