*android.support.v7.internal.view.SupportMenuInflater_Description*

This class is used to instantiate menu XML files into Menu objects. 

For performance reasons, menu inflation relies heavily on pre-processing of XML 
files that is done at build time. Therefore, it is not currently possible to 
use SupportMenuInflater with an XmlPullParser over a plain XML file at runtime; 
it only works with an XmlPullParser returned from a compiled resource (R. 
something file.) 



*android.support.v7.internal.view.SupportMenuInflater(Context)*

public SupportMenuInflater(Context context)

Constructs a menu inflater. 


*android.support.v7.internal.view.SupportMenuInflater.inflate(int,Menu)*

public void inflate(
  int menuRes,
  Menu menu)

Inflate a menu hierarchy from the specified XML resource. Throws 
(|InflateException|) if there is an error. 


    menuRes - Resource ID for an XML layout resource to load (e.g., R.menu.main_activity) 
    menu - The Menu to inflate into. The items and submenus will be added to this Menu.
