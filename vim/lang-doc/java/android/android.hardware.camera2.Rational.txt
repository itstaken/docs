*android.hardware.camera2.Rational_Description*

The rational data type used by CameraMetadata keys. Contains a pair of ints 
representing the numerator and denominator of a Rational number. This type is 
immutable. 



*android.hardware.camera2.Rational(int,int)*

public Rational(
  int numerator,
  int denominator)

Create a Rational with a given numerator and denominator. 

The signs of the numerator and the denominator may be flipped such that the 
denominator is always positive. 

A rational value with a 0-denominator may be constructed, but will have similar 
semantics as float NaN and INF values. The int getter functions return 0 in 
this case. 

    numerator - the numerator of the rational 
    denominator - the denominator of the rational 

*android.hardware.camera2.Rational.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj)

Compare this Rational to another object and see if they are equal. 

A Rational object can only be equal to another Rational object (comparing 
against any other type will return false). 

A Rational object is considered equal to another Rational object if and only if 
one of the following holds: Both are NaN Both are infinities of the same sign 
Both have the same numerator and denominator in their reduced form 

A reduced form of a Rational is calculated by dividing both the numerator and 
the denominator by their greatest common divisor. 



(new Rational(1, 2)).equals(new Rational(1, 2)) == true // trivially true (new 
Rational(2, 3)).equals(new Rational(1, 2)) == false // trivially false (new 
Rational(1, 2)).equals(new Rational(2, 4)) == true // true after reduction (new 
Rational(0, 0)).equals(new Rational(0, 0)) == true // NaN.equals(NaN) (new 
Rational(1, 0)).equals(new Rational(5, 0)) == true // both are +infinity (new 
Rational(1, 0)).equals(new Rational(-1, 0)) == false // +infinity != -infinity 


    obj - a reference to another object 

    Returns: A boolean that determines whether or not the two Rational objects are equal. 

*android.hardware.camera2.Rational.gcd()*

public int gcd()

Calculates the greatest common divisor using Euclid's algorithm. 



    Returns: An int value representing the gcd. Always positive. 

*android.hardware.camera2.Rational.getDenominator()*

public int getDenominator()

Gets the denominator of the rational 



*android.hardware.camera2.Rational.getNumerator()*

public int getNumerator()

Gets the numerator of the rational. 



*android.hardware.camera2.Rational.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()





*android.hardware.camera2.Rational.toFloat()*

public float toFloat()

Convert to a floating point representation. 



    Returns: The floating point representation of this rational number. 

*android.hardware.camera2.Rational.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()
