*android.os.CommonTimeConfig.OnServerDiedListener_Description*

The OnServerDiedListener interface defines a method called by the 
(|android.os.CommonTimeConfig|) instance to indicate that the connection to the 
native media server has been broken and that the 
(|android.os.CommonTimeConfig|) instance will need to be released and 
re-created. The client application can implement this interface and register 
the listener with the (|android.os.CommonTimeConfig.OnServerDiedListener|) 
method. 



*android.os.CommonTimeConfig.OnServerDiedListener.onServerDied()*

common time service encounters a fatal error and needs to restart, the binder 
connection from the (|android.os.CommonTimeConfig|) instance to the common time 
service will be broken.
