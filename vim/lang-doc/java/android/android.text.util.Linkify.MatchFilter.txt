*android.text.util.Linkify.MatchFilter_Description*

MatchFilter enables client code to have more control over what is allowed to 
match and become a link, and what is not. 

For example: when matching web urls you would like things like 
http://www.example.com to match, as well as just example.com itelf. However, 
you would not want to match against the domain in support@example.com. So, when 
matching against a web url pattern you might also include a MatchFilter that 
disallows the match if it is immediately preceded by an at-sign (@). 



*android.text.util.Linkify.MatchFilter.acceptMatch(CharSequence,int,int)*

public boolean acceptMatch(
  java.lang.CharSequence s,
  int start,
  int end)

Examines the character span matched by the pattern and determines if the match 
should be turned into an actionable link. 


    s - The body of text against which the pattern was matched 
    start - The index of the first character in s that was matched by the pattern - 
       inclusive 
    end - The index of the last character in s that was matched - exclusive 

    Returns: Whether this match should be turned into a link
