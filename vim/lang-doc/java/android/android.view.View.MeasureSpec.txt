*android.view.View.MeasureSpec_Description*

A MeasureSpec encapsulates the layout requirements passed from parent to child. 
Each MeasureSpec represents a requirement for either the width or the height. A 
MeasureSpec is comprised of a size and a mode. There are three possible modes: 

UNSPECIFIED 

The parent has not imposed any constraint on the child. It can be whatever size 
it wants. 

EXACTLY 

The parent has determined an exact size for the child. The child is going to be 
given those bounds regardless of how big it wants to be. 

AT_MOST 

The child can be as large as it wants up to the specified size. 



MeasureSpecs are implemented as ints to reduce object allocation. This class is 
provided to pack and unpack the <size, mode> tuple into the int. 



*int_android.view.View.MeasureSpec.AT_MOST*

Measure specification mode: The child can be as large as it wants up to the 
specified size. 


*int_android.view.View.MeasureSpec.EXACTLY*

Measure specification mode: The parent has determined an exact size for the 
child. The child is going to be given those bounds regardless of how big it 
wants to be. 


*int_android.view.View.MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED*

Measure specification mode: The parent has not imposed any constraint on the 
child. It can be whatever size it wants.

public View.MeasureSpec()




*android.view.View.MeasureSpec.getMode(int)*

public static int getMode(int measureSpec)

Extracts the mode from the supplied measure specification. 


    measureSpec - the measure specification to extract the mode from 

    Returns: {@link android.view.View.MeasureSpec#UNSPECIFIED}, {@link 
             android.view.View.MeasureSpec#AT_MOST} or {@link 
             android.view.View.MeasureSpec#EXACTLY} 

*android.view.View.MeasureSpec.getSize(int)*

public static int getSize(int measureSpec)

Extracts the size from the supplied measure specification. 


    measureSpec - the measure specification to extract the size from 

    Returns: the size in pixels defined in the supplied measure specification 

*android.view.View.MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(int,int)*

public static int makeMeasureSpec(
  int size,
  int mode)

Creates a measure specification based on the supplied size and mode. 

The mode must always be one of the following: 

(|android.view.View.MeasureSpec|) (|android.view.View.MeasureSpec|) 
(|android.view.View.MeasureSpec|) 

Note: On API level 17 and lower, makeMeasureSpec's implementation was such that 
the order of arguments did not matter and overflow in either value could impact 
the resulting MeasureSpec. (|android.widget.RelativeLayout|) was affected by 
this bug. Apps targeting API levels greater than 17 will get the fixed, more 
strict behavior. 


    size - the size of the measure specification 
    mode - the mode of the measure specification 

    Returns: the measure specification based on size and mode 

*android.view.View.MeasureSpec.toString(int)*

public static |java.lang.String| toString(int measureSpec)

Returns a String representation of the specified measure specification. 


    measureSpec - the measure specification to convert to a String 

    Returns: a String with the following format: "MeasureSpec: MODE SIZE"
