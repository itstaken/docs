*android.view.TouchDelegate_Description*

Helper class to handle situations where you want a view to have a larger touch 
area than its actual view bounds. The view whose touch area is changed is 
called the delegate view. This class should be used by an ancestor of the 
delegate. To use a TouchDelegate, first create an instance that specifies the 
bounds that should be mapped to the delegate and the delegate view itself. 

The ancestor should then forward all of its touch events received in its 
(|android.view.View|) to (|android.view.TouchDelegate|) . 



*int_android.view.TouchDelegate.ABOVE*

The touchable region of the View extends above its actual extent. 


*int_android.view.TouchDelegate.BELOW*

The touchable region of the View extends below its actual extent. 


*int_android.view.TouchDelegate.TO_LEFT*

The touchable region of the View extends to the left of its actual extent. 


*int_android.view.TouchDelegate.TO_RIGHT*

The touchable region of the View extends to the right of its actual extent. 



*android.view.TouchDelegate(Rect,View)*

public TouchDelegate(
  Rect bounds,
  android.view.View delegateView)

Constructor 

    bounds - Bounds in local coordinates of the containing view that should be mapped to the 
       delegate view 
    delegateView - The view that should receive motion events 

*android.view.TouchDelegate.onTouchEvent(MotionEvent)*

public boolean onTouchEvent(android.view.MotionEvent event)

Will forward touch events to the delegate view if the event is within the 
bounds specified in the constructor. 


    event - The touch event to forward 

    Returns: True if the event was forwarded to the delegate, false otherwise.
