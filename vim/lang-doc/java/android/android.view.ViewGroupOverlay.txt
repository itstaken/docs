*android.view.ViewGroupOverlay_Description*

A group overlay is an extra layer that sits on top of a ViewGroup (the "host 
view") which is drawn after all other content in that view (including the view 
group's children). Interaction with the overlay layer is done by adding and 
removing views and drawables. 

ViewGroupOverlay is a subclass of (|android.view.ViewOverlay|) , adding the 
ability to manage views for overlays on ViewGroups, in addition to the drawable 
support in ViewOverlay. 



*android.view.ViewGroupOverlay.add(View)*

public void add(android.view.View view)

Adds a View to the overlay. The bounds of the added view should be relative to 
the host view. Any view added to the overlay should be removed when it is no 
longer needed or no longer visible. 

Views in the overlay are visual-only; they do not receive input events and do 
not participate in focus traversal. Overlay views are intended to be transient, 
such as might be needed by a temporary animation effect. 

If the view has a parent, the view will be removed from that parent before 
being added to the overlay. Also, if that parent is attached in the current 
view hierarchy, the view will be repositioned such that it is in the same 
relative location inside the activity. For example, if the view's current 
parent lies 100 pixels to the right and 200 pixels down from the origin of the 
overlay's host view, then the view will be offset by (100, 200). 


    view - The View to be added to the overlay. The added view will be drawn when the 
       overlay is drawn. 

*android.view.ViewGroupOverlay.remove(View)*

public void remove(android.view.View view)

Removes the specified View from the overlay. 


    view - The View to be removed from the overlay.
