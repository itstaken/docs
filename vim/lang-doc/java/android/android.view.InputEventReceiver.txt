*android.view.InputEventReceiver_Description*

Provides a low-level mechanism for an application to receive input events. 



*android.view.InputEventReceiver(InputChannel,Looper)*

public InputEventReceiver(
  android.view.InputChannel inputChannel,
  android.os.Looper looper)

Creates an input event receiver bound to the specified input channel. 

    inputChannel - The input channel. 
    looper - The looper to use when invoking callbacks. 

*android.view.InputEventReceiver.consumeBatchedInputEvents(long)*

public final boolean consumeBatchedInputEvents(long frameTimeNanos)

Consumes all pending batched input events. Must be called on the same Looper 
thread to which the receiver is attached. 

This method forces all batched input events to be delivered immediately. Should 
be called just before animating or drawing a new frame in the UI. 


    frameTimeNanos - The time in the {@link System#nanoTime()} time base when the current display 
       frame started rendering, or -1 if unknown. 

    Returns: Whether a batch was consumed 

*android.view.InputEventReceiver.dispose()*

public void dispose()

Disposes the receiver. 



*android.view.InputEventReceiver.finalize()*

protected void finalize()
  throws |java.lang.Throwable|
         




*android.view.InputEventReceiver.finishInputEvent(InputEvent,boolean)*

public final void finishInputEvent(
  android.view.InputEvent event,
  boolean handled)

Finishes an input event and indicates whether it was handled. Must be called on 
the same Looper thread to which the receiver is attached. 


    event - The input event that was finished. 
    handled - True if the event was handled. 

*android.view.InputEventReceiver.onBatchedInputEventPending()*

public void onBatchedInputEventPending()

Called when a batched input event is pending. 

The batched input event will continue to accumulate additional movement samples 
until the recipient calls (|android.view.InputEventReceiver|) or an event is 
received that ends the batch and causes it to be consumed immediately (such as 
a pointer up event). 



*android.view.InputEventReceiver.onInputEvent(InputEvent)*

public void onInputEvent(android.view.InputEvent event)

Called when an input event is received. The recipient should process the input 
event and then call (|android.view.InputEventReceiver|) to indicate whether the 
event was handled. No new input events will be received until 
(|android.view.InputEventReceiver|) is called. 


    event - The input event that was received.
