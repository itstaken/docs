*android.hardware.Camera.AutoFocusCallback_Description*

Callback interface used to notify on completion of camera auto focus. 

Devices that do not support auto-focus will receive a "fake" callback to this 
interface. If your application needs auto-focus and should not be installed on 
devices without auto-focus, you must declare that your app uses 
theandroid.hardware.camera.autofocusfeature, in the <a 
href="guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element.html"><uses-feature> manifest 
element. 



*android.hardware.Camera.AutoFocusCallback.onAutoFocus(boolean,Camera)*

public void onAutoFocus(
  boolean success,
  android.hardware.Camera camera)

Called when the camera auto focus completes. If the camera does not support 
auto-focus and autoFocus is called, onAutoFocus will be called immediately with 
a fake value of success set to true. 

The auto-focus routine does not lock auto-exposure and auto-white balance after 
it completes. 


    success - true if focus was successful, false if otherwise 
    camera - the Camera service object
