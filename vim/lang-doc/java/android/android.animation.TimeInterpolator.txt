*android.animation.TimeInterpolator_Description*

A time interpolator defines the rate of change of an animation. This allows 
animations to have non-linear motion, such as acceleration and deceleration. 



*android.animation.TimeInterpolator.getInterpolation(float)*

public float getInterpolation(float input)

Maps a value representing the elapsed fraction of an animation to a value that 
represents the interpolated fraction. This interpolated value is then 
multiplied by the change in value of an animation to derive the animated value 
at the current elapsed animation time. 


    input - A value between 0 and 1.0 indicating our current point in the animation where 0 
       represents the start and 1.0 represents the end 

    Returns: The interpolation value. This value can be more than 1.0 for interpolators 
             which overshoot their targets, or less than 0 for interpolators 
             that undershoot their targets.
