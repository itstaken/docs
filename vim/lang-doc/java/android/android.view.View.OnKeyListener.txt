*android.view.View.OnKeyListener_Description*

Interface definition for a callback to be invoked when a hardware key event is 
dispatched to this view. The callback will be invoked before the key event is 
given to the view. This is only useful for hardware keyboards; a software input 
method has no obligation to trigger this listener. 



*android.view.View.OnKeyListener.onKey(View,int,KeyEvent)*

public boolean onKey(
  android.view.View v,
  int keyCode,
  android.view.KeyEvent event)

Called when a hardware key is dispatched to a view. This allows listeners to 
get a chance to respond before the target view. Key presses in software 
keyboards will generally NOT trigger this method, although some may elect to do 
so in some situations. Do not assume a software input method has to be 
key-based; even if it is, it may use key presses in a different way than you 
expect, so there is no way to reliably catch soft input key presses. 


    v - The view the key has been dispatched to. 
    keyCode - The code for the physical key that was pressed 
    event - The KeyEvent object containing full information about the event. 

    Returns: True if the listener has consumed the event, false otherwise.
