*android.animation.TimeAnimator_Description*

This class provides a simple callback mechanism to listeners that is 
synchronized with all other animators in the system. There is no duration, 
interpolation, or object value-setting with this Animator. Instead, it is 
simply started, after which it proceeds to send out events on every animation 
frame to its TimeListener (if set), with information about this animator, the 
total elapsed time, and the elapsed time since the previous animation frame.
