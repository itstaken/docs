*java.lang.AssertionError_Description*

Thrown to indicate that an assertion has failed. 

The seven one-argument public constructors provided by this class ensure that 
the assertion error returned by the invocation: 

new AssertionError(expression) 

has as its detail message the string conversion of expression (as defined in 
section 15.18.1.1 of The Java Language Specification), regardless of the type 
of expression. 



*java.lang.AssertionError()*

public AssertionError()

Constructs an AssertionError with no detail message. 


*java.lang.AssertionError(boolean)*

public AssertionError(boolean detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
boolean, which is converted to a string as defined in section 15.18.1.1 of The 
Java Language Specification. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(char)*

public AssertionError(char detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
char, which is converted to a string as defined in section 15.18.1.1 of The 
Java Language Specification. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(double)*

public AssertionError(double detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
double, which is converted to a string as defined in section 15.18.1.1 of The 
Java Language Specification. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(float)*

public AssertionError(float detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
float, which is converted to a string as defined in section 15.18.1.1 of The 
Java Language Specification. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(int)*

public AssertionError(int detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
int, which is converted to a string as defined in section 15.18.1.1 of The Java 
Language Specification. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(long)*

public AssertionError(long detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
long, which is converted to a string as defined in section 15.18.1.1 of The 
Java Language Specification. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(Object)*

public AssertionError(java.lang.Object detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
object, which is converted to a string as defined in section 15.18.1.1 of The 
Java Language Specification. 

If the specified object is an instance ofThrowable, it becomes the cause of the 
newly constructed assertion error. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(String,Throwable)*

public AssertionError(
  java.lang.String message,
  java.lang.Throwable cause)

Constructs a newAssertionErrorwith the specified detail message and cause. 

Note that the detail message associated withcauseis not automatically 
incorporated in this error's detail message. 

    message - the detail message, may be {@code null} 
    cause - the cause, may be {@code null}
