*javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager_Description*

Instance of this interface manage which X509 certificates may be used to 
authenticate the remote side of a secure socket. Decisions may be based on 
trusted certificate authorities, certificate revocation lists, online status 
checking or other means. 



*javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager.checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[],String)*

public void checkClientTrusted(
  java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] chain,
  java.lang.String authType)
  throws |java.security.cert.CertificateException|
         
Given the partial or complete certificate chain provided by the peer, build a 
certificate path to a trusted root and return if it can be validated and is 
trusted for client SSL authentication based on the authentication type. 

The authentication type is determined by the actual certificate used. For 
instance, if RSAPublicKey is used, the authType should be "RSA". Checking is 
case-sensitive. 


    chain - the peer certificate chain 
    authType - the authentication type based on the client certificate 

*javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager.checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[],String)*

public void checkServerTrusted(
  java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] chain,
  java.lang.String authType)
  throws |java.security.cert.CertificateException|
         
Given the partial or complete certificate chain provided by the peer, build a 
certificate path to a trusted root and return if it can be validated and is 
trusted for server SSL authentication based on the authentication type. 

The authentication type is the key exchange algorithm portion of the cipher 
suites represented as a String, such as "RSA", "DHE_DSS". Note: for some 
exportable cipher suites, the key exchange algorithm is determined at run time 
during the handshake. For instance, for TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5, the 
authType should be RSA_EXPORT when an ephemeral RSA key is used for the key 
exchange, and RSA when the key from the server certificate is used. Checking is 
case-sensitive.

    authType - the key exchange algorithm used 

*javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager.getAcceptedIssuers()*

public |java.security.cert.X509Certificate|[] getAcceptedIssuers()

Return an array of certificate authority certificates which are trusted for 
authenticating peers. 



    Returns: a non-null (possibly empty) array of acceptable CA issuer certificates.
