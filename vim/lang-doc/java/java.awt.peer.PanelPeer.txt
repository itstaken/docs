*java.awt.peer.PanelPeer_Description*

The peer interface for (|Panel|) . This is a subinterface of ContainerPeer and 
does not declare any additional methods because a Panel is just that, a 
concrete Container. 

The peer interfaces are intended only for use in porting the AWT. They are not 
intended for use by application developers, and developers should not implement 
peers nor invoke any of the peer methods directly on the peer instances.
