*java.awt.peer.ContainerPeer_Description*

The peer interface for (|java.awt.Container|) . This is the parent interface 
for all container like widgets. 

The peer interfaces are intended only for use in porting the AWT. They are not 
intended for use by application developers, and developers should not implement 
peers nor invoke any of the peer methods directly on the peer instances. 



*java.awt.peer.ContainerPeer.beginLayout()*

public void beginLayout()

Notifies the peer that layout is about to begin. This is called before the 
container itself and its children are laid out. 



*java.awt.peer.ContainerPeer.beginValidate()*

public void beginValidate()

Notifies the peer that validation of the component tree is about to begin. 



*java.awt.peer.ContainerPeer.endLayout()*

public void endLayout()

Notifies the peer that layout is finished. This is called after the container 
and its children have been laid out. 



*java.awt.peer.ContainerPeer.endValidate()*

public void endValidate()

Notifies the peer that validation of the component tree is finished. 



*java.awt.peer.ContainerPeer.getInsets()*

public |java.awt.Insets| getInsets()

Returns the insets of this container. Insets usually is the space that is
