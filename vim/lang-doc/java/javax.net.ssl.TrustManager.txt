*javax.net.ssl.TrustManager_Description*

This is the base interface for JSSE trust managers. 

TrustManagers are responsible for managing the trust material that is used when 
making trust decisions, and for deciding whether credentials presented by a 
peer should be accepted. 

TrustManagers are created by either using a TrustManagerFactory, or by 
implementing one of the TrustManager subclasses.
