*javax.net.ssl.SSLSessionBindingListener_Description*

This interface is implemented by objects which want to know when they are being 
bound or unbound from a SSLSession. When either event occurs via 
(|javax.net.ssl.SSLSession|) or (|javax.net.ssl.SSLSession|) , the event is 
communicated through a SSLSessionBindingEvent identifying the session. 



*javax.net.ssl.SSLSessionBindingListener.valueBound(SSLSessionBindingEvent)*

public void valueBound(javax.net.ssl.SSLSessionBindingEvent event)

This is called to notify the listener that it is being bound into an 
SSLSession. 


    event - the event identifying the SSLSession into which the listener is being bound. 

*javax.net.ssl.SSLSessionBindingListener.valueUnbound(SSLSessionBindingEvent)*

public void valueUnbound(javax.net.ssl.SSLSessionBindingEvent event)

This is called to notify the listener that it is being unbound from a 
SSLSession. 


    event - the event identifying the SSLSession from which the listener is being unbound.
