*javax.crypto.SecretKey_Description*

A secret (symmetric) key. 

This interface contains no methods or constants. Its only purpose is to group 
(and provide type safety for) secret keys. 

Provider implementations of this interface must overwrite the equals and 
hashCode methods inherited from java.lang.Object, so that secret keys are 
compared based on their underlying key material and not based on reference. 

Keys that implement this interface return the string RAW as their encoding 
format (see getFormat), and return the raw key bytes as the result of a 
getEncoded method call. (The getFormat and getEncoded methods are inherited 
from the java.security.Key parent interface.) 



*long_javax.crypto.SecretKey.serialVersionUID*

The class fingerprint that is set to indicate serialization compatibility since 
J2SE 1.4.
