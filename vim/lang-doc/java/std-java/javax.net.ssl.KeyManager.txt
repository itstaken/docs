*javax.net.ssl.KeyManager_Description*

This is the base interface for JSSE key managers. 

KeyManagers are responsible for managing the key material which is used to 
authenticate the local SSLSocket to its peer. If no key material is available, 
the socket will be unable to present authentication credentials. 

KeyManagers are created by either using a KeyManagerFactory, or by implementing 
one of the KeyManager subclasses.
