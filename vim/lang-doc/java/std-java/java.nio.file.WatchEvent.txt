*java.nio.file.WatchEvent_Description*

An event or a repeated event for an object that is registered with a 
(|java.nio.file.WatchService|) . 

An event is classified by its kind(|java.nio.file.WatchEvent|) and has a 
count(|java.nio.file.WatchEvent|) to indicate the number of times that the 
event has been observed. This allows for efficient representation of repeated 
events. The context(|java.nio.file.WatchEvent|) method returns any context 
associated with the event. In the case of a repeated event then the context is 
the same for all events. 

Watch events are immutable and safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. 



*java.nio.file.WatchEvent.context()*

public |T| context()

Returns the context for the event. 

In the case of ENTRY_CREATE(|java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKinds|) , 
ENTRY_DELETE(|java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKinds|) , and 
ENTRY_MODIFY(|java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKinds|) events the context is 
aPaththat is the relative(|java.nio.file.Path|) path between the directory 
registered with the watch service, and the entry that is created, deleted, or 
modified. 



    Returns: the event context; may be {@code null} 

*java.nio.file.WatchEvent.count()*

public int count()

Returns the event count. If the event count is greater than1then this is a 
repeated event. 



    Returns: the event count 

*java.nio.file.WatchEvent.kind()*

public |java.nio.file.WatchEvent.Kind|<T> kind()

Returns the event kind. 



    Returns: the event kind
