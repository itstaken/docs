*javax.smartcardio.CardTerminal_Description*

A Smart Card terminal, sometimes refered to as a Smart Card Reader. A 
CardTerminal object can be obtained by calling 
(|javax.smartcardio.CardTerminals|) or 
CardTerminals.getTerminal()(|javax.smartcardio.CardTerminals|) . 

Note that physical card readers with slots for multiple cards are represented 
by one CardTerminal object per such slot. 



*javax.smartcardio.CardTerminal()*

protected CardTerminal()

Constructs a new CardTerminal object. 

This constructor is called by subclasses only. Application should call 
list()(|javax.smartcardio.CardTerminals|) or 
getTerminal()(|javax.smartcardio.CardTerminals|) to obtain a CardTerminal 
object. 


*javax.smartcardio.CardTerminal.connect(String)*

public abstract |javax.smartcardio.Card| connect(java.lang.String protocol)
  throws |javax.smartcardio.CardException|
         
Establishes a connection to the card. If a connection has previously 
established using the specified protocol, this method returns the same Card 
object as the previous call. 


    protocol - the protocol to use ("T=0", "T=1", or "T=CL"), or "*" to connect using any 
       available protocol. 

*javax.smartcardio.CardTerminal.getName()*

public abstract |java.lang.String| getName()

Returns the unique name of this terminal. 



    Returns: the unique name of this terminal. 

*javax.smartcardio.CardTerminal.isCardPresent()*

public abstract boolean isCardPresent()
  throws |javax.smartcardio.CardException|
         
Returns whether a card is present in this terminal. 



    Returns: whether a card is present in this terminal. 

*javax.smartcardio.CardTerminal.waitForCardAbsent(long)*

public abstract boolean waitForCardAbsent(long timeout)
  throws |javax.smartcardio.CardException|
         
Waits until a card is absent in this terminal or the timeout expires. If the 
method returns due to an expired timeout, it returns false. Otherwise it return 
true. 

If no card is present in this terminal when this method is called, it returns 
immediately. 


    timeout - if positive, block for up to timeout milliseconds; if zero, block indefinitely; 
       must not be negative 

    Returns: false if the method returns due to an expired timeout, true otherwise. 

*javax.smartcardio.CardTerminal.waitForCardPresent(long)*

public abstract boolean waitForCardPresent(long timeout)
  throws |javax.smartcardio.CardException|
         
Waits until a card is present in this terminal or the timeout expires. If the 
method returns due to an expired timeout, it returns false. Otherwise it return 
true. 

If a card is present in this terminal when this method is called, it returns 
immediately. 


    timeout - if positive, block for up to timeout milliseconds; if zero, block indefinitely; 
       must not be negative 

    Returns: false if the method returns due to an expired timeout, true otherwise.
