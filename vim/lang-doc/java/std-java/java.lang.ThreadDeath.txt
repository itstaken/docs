*java.lang.ThreadDeath_Description*

An instance ofThreadDeathis thrown in the victim thread when the (deprecated) 
(|java.lang.Thread|) method is invoked. 

An application should catch instances of this class only if it must clean up 
after being terminated asynchronously. IfThreadDeathis caught by a method, it 
is important that it be rethrown so that the thread actually dies. 

The top-level error handler(|java.lang.ThreadGroup|) does not print out a 
message ifThreadDeathis never caught. 

The classThreadDeathis specifically a subclass ofErrorrather thanException, 
even though it is a "normal occurrence", because many applications catch all 
occurrences ofExceptionand then discard the exception.
